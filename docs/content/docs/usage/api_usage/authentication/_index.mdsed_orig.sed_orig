## Anchore Engine Authentication Overview

Anchore Engine supports two ways for users to authenticate to the API: HTTP Basic and Bearer Tokens. HTTP Basic is always 
supported but Bearer token auth must be explicitly configured to be used.

For production installation, it is recommended to [configure bearer tokens as well as hashed password storage]({{< ref "/docs/engine/engine_installation/configuration/user_credential_storage" >}}) 
in the db to ensure that no clear text password is present anywhere in the system. Because the system uses credentials for 
internal service-to-service communication, it is required that if hashing passwords is configured that oauth also be enabled 
to allow inter-service communication using service-generated tokens.

This will require providing a shared secret across all components or a pair of public/private keys. Each service must have 
exactly the same secret or key-pair present.
 

### Basic Auth

By default, Anchore Engine uses [HTTP Basic](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) auth for all internal and external API 
operations. For production deployments with this mode, it is critical to use HTTPS to secure the communication channel 
between services and users. See: [Configuring HTTPS]({{< ref "/docs/engine/engine_installation/configuration/tls_ssl_config" >}}) for setup information.

Example Usage:

    [root@4a1b1d9105a8 ~]# curl -v -u admin:foobar http://localhost:8228/v1/accounts
    * About to connect() to localhost port 8228 (#0)
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
    * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8228 (#0)
    * Server auth using Basic with user 'admin'
    > GET /v1/accounts HTTP/1.1
    > Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46Zm9vYmFy
    > User-Agent: curl/7.29.0
    > Host: localhost:8228
    > Accept: */*

        "name": "admin",
        "state": "enabled",
        "type": "admin"
      }
    ]

### Bearer Tokens/Oauth

When configured, anchore implements the Oauth2 Password grant flow. Anchore is configured with a default 'anonymous' client 
id that is used to avoid requiring registering specific clients.

Required payload, must be www-form-urlencoded:

    grant_type=password
    username=<user>
    password=<password>
    client_id=anonymous

The payload is sent using HTTP POST to the _/v1/oauth/token_ endpoint. The returned token is valid until expiration (typically 1 hour) 
and is used by sending it in the _Authorization_ header as a bearer token:

Example usage:

    
    root@4a1b1d9105a8 ~]# curl -v -d 'grant_type=password&client_id=anonymous&username=admin&password=foobar' -X POST http://localhost:8228/v1/oauth/token
    * About to connect() to localhost port 8228 (#0)
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
    * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8228 (#0)
    > POST /v1/oauth/token HTTP/1.1
